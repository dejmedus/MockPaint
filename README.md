### Remake a Paint App

MockPaint is a pared-down clone of MS Paint created with [P5.js](https://p5js.org) for [Global Hack Week's](https://ghw.mlh.io/oct) Remake a Paint App challenge.

Currently you can:

- Draw with a pen or brush
- Set a brush width (max 980px)
- Erase your work
- Choose from 12 colors
- Clear the canvas

Still to be implemented:

- Shapes
- Proper fill/bucket functionality
- Choose your own color palette
- Switch between 2 primary colors
- UI Themes
- Undo actions
- Save your work

#### Setup

To setup and view this project in the browser I used the p5.vscode and Live Server VSCode extensions. For alternatives, see the P5.js [Get Started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) guide.
